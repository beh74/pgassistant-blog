**pgAssistant** helps you design your schema, understand and optimize PostgreSQL database performance.

- ✨ Open-source
- 🐘 Built for PostgreSQL

👉 Explore the documentation, the posts or [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nexsol-technologies/pgassistant)

👉If you are looking for good tools to work with postgres, you should have a look on [this](https://github.com/dhamaniasad/awesome-postgres)

## Before you begin

Read this documentation :
- [Enable pg_stat_statements](doc/pg_stat_statments)
- [Quick start with docker](doc/startup_docker)

## Complementary Tools for Working with pgAssistant

While **pgAssistant** is focused on helping you optimize SQL query performance, it is **not intended for real-time PostgreSQL monitoring**.

If you're looking to **monitor performance metrics**, track query evolution over time, or get deep visibility into your PostgreSQL instance, we highly recommend the open-source tool **[pgWatch](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/pgwatch)**.

✨ Why pgWatch?

- Built with **Go** → fast and efficient
- **Docker-based** deployment → quick and easy to set up
- Uses industry standards like **Grafana** and **Prometheus** for beautiful dashboards and alerting. 

> pgWatch is a great complement to pgAssistant — one helps you improve your queries, the other helps you monitor them in action.
