# Privacy
 
Data privacy is no longer a luxury â€” itâ€™s a necessity.

Today, weâ€™ll show you how to use pgAssistant with [Infomaniak Cloud](https://www.infomaniak.com/fr/hebergement/ai-tools) â€” Infomaniak's privacy-focused, sovereign cloud solution based in SwitzerlandðŸ‡¨.

## Why Data Sovereignty Matters

When using AI tools in the cloud, where your data is processed and stored has a major impact:

- **Legal compliance (e.g. GDPR)**
- **Data residency requirements**
- **Protection from mass surveillance**

Infomaniakâ€™s Swiss Cloud is one of the few solutions that:
- Is fully hosted in **Switzerland**
- Operates under strict **Swiss privacy laws**
- Is ISO 27001 / GDPR compliant
- Powered by **renewable energy**

Perfect match for privacy-conscious developers and European companies.

## How to use my Infomaniak account with pgAssistant

I recommend to use the **llama3** model with pgAssistant, which gives good results.

The Environment variable LOCAL_LLM_URI must contains your **product ID** like this : https://api.infomaniak.com/1/ai/<productid>/openai
    
The Environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY is the value of your **token API**.
    
    
## docker-compose.yml file with Infomaniak account
```  
services:
  pgassistant:
    image: nexsoltech/pgassistant:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=fGIDaOIfn-xxxxx
      - OPENAI_API_MODEL=llama3
      - LOCAL_LLM_URI=https://api.infomaniak.com/1/ai/108043/openai
      - SECRET_KEY=bertrand
    ports:
      - "8080:5005"
    volumes:
      - ./myqueries.json:/home/pgassistant/myqueries.json
```

## Conclusion

If you donâ€™t have the resources to set up an on-premise infrastructure capable of running open-source LLMs, but data privacy still matters to you, then Infomaniakâ€™s sovereign cloud is definitely worth considering.

Iâ€™ve been using it personally for several months and Iâ€™m genuinely impressed. For me, it checks all the right boxes:

âœ… Strong privacy guarantees

âœ… Affordable pricing (my pricing this month for Input tokens : 1082936, Output tokens : 123411 = 1.82 EUR. With OpenAI, estimated price : 15 EUR)

âœ… Solid performance

Just to be clear: I have no commercial relationship with Infomaniak â€” this is simply a personal recommendation based on real usage.
